## Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free softwareâ€”to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to ensure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must ensure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

### 0. Applicability
This License applies to any program or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program" refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. Each licensee is addressed as "you."

Activities other than copying, distribution, and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

### 1. Copying and Distribution
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

### 2. Modifications
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1, provided that you also meet the following conditions:

- **a)** You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
- **b)** You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
- **c)** If the modified program normally reads commands interactively, you must cause it to display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and notice of no warranty (or state that you provide a warranty) and inform the user of their rights under this License.

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. However, if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program and can be reasonably considered independent, this License does not apply to those sections when you distribute them separately.

### 3. Distribution in Object Code or Executable Form
You may distribute the Program in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2, provided that you do one of the following:

- **a)** Accompany it with the complete source code.
- **b)** Accompany it with a written offer to provide the source code for a fee.
- **c)** Accompany it with the information received as to the offer to distribute source code.

### 4. Restrictions
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any other attempt to do so is void and will terminate your rights under this License.

### 5. Acceptance and Use
Modifying or distributing the Program implies acceptance of this License and its terms.

### 6. Automatic Licensing
Each time you redistribute the Program, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor.

### 7. Court Rulings and Patent Issues
If conditions are imposed on you that contradict this License, you may not distribute the Program.

### 8. Geographical Restrictions
The original copyright holder may add restrictions based on geographical distribution.

### 9. Future Versions
The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of this License.

### 10. Incorporating the Program into Other Works
For permissions beyond this License, contact the author or the Free Software Foundation.
