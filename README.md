# PHP Timeclock Project

## Yup, Good Ole PHP Timeclock Never Dies
Believe it or not, this project has been ticking along since the days of PHP 4, and guess what? It's still going strongâ€”at least with me! This trusty, classic time-tracking tool has seen it all, from the rise of MySpace to the era of TikTok. While the world has moved on to flashier, trendier apps, PHP Timeclock remains a steadfast companion for those who appreciate a no-nonsense approach to time management. I might be the last one keeping it alive, but hey, legends never die, right?

## Overview
PHP Timeclock is a simple yet effective web-based timeclock system designed to track employee work hours and manage basic administrative tasks. This project has been updated to work seamlessly with PHP 8.2, ensuring compatibility with modern web environments. The original weather feature has been removed due to stability issues, and timestamps are now stored in UTC in the database.

## Features
- Web-based time tracking system for employees
- Administration panel for user management and time modifications
- Compatible with pre-existing PHP Timeclock databases
- Updated to function with PHP 8.2
- Timestamps saved in UTC

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Configure the application**:
   - Copy the example configuration file:
     ```bash
     cp config.example.inc.php config.inc.php
     ```
   - Open `config.inc.php` and enter your database connection details.

3. **Import the database schema**:
   - Import the provided SQL script:
     ```bash
     mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < create_tables.sql
     ```

4. **Access the application**:
   - Visit `index.php` in your web browser to start using the application.

## Notes
- No changes were made to the database schema, so existing PHP Timeclock databases will work with this version.
- The weather feature has been removed for improved performance and reliability.
- Existing PHP Timeclock databases will have to have timestamps changed out to UTC.
